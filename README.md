# machine-learning
a script that trains a Decision Tree Classifier on a dataset of murder records

 I wanted to do some messing around with a murder database after having seen the tv show "Mindhunter" where an FBI agent is convinced the perpetrator must be of black ethnicity when all his victims are black.

#

 I fully realize serial killers and single count murders differ vastly when it comes to the psychology of the murderer involved, but I still thought it interesting enough to have a look at some real life data and find a way to predict the race of the killer based on race of the victim

 After encoding the data to integers and feeding this to the machine learning algorithm, it seems there's about a 60% accuracy in predicting the perp based on race
