# mindhunter
a script that trains a Decision Tree Classifier on a dataset of murder records

#

 I wanted to go over a murder database after having seen the tv show "Mindhunter" where an FBI agent is convinced the perpetrator must be of black ethnicity when all his victims are black.

#

 I fully realize serial killers and single count murders differ vastly when it comes to the psychology of the murderer involved, but I still thought it interesting enough to have a look at some real life data and find a way to predict the race of the killer based on race of the victim

 Using this dataset and the model I opted for, it seems there's about a 60% accuracy in predicting the perp based on race
